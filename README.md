# Regressions
We have here three types of regressions and also three datasets. The code is in python and the libraries which are used are those from sklearn.

# Polynomial regression
Here we can see how a non-linear model can predict something. Here we wanted to predict if an employee is bluffing regarding his previous salary which depends his previous position. For getting this we need a non- linear model.

# Simple linear regression
In this plot you can see how this model can predict the salary of a person depending of his years of experience.
